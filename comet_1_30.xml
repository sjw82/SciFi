        <title>THE COMET</title>
        <author>W.E.B. DuBois</author>
    </metadata>
    <body>
        <p>He stood a moment on the steps of the bank, watching the human river that swirled down
            Broadway. Few noticed him. Few ever noticed him save in a way that stung. <axes
                trait="class" character="Jim">He was outside the world—<quotes>nothing!</quotes> as
                he said bitterly.</axes> Bits of the words of the walkers came to him.</p>
        <p><quotes>The comet?</quotes></p>
        <p><quotes>The comet——</quotes></p>
        <p>Everybody was talking of it. Even the president, as he entered, <axes trait="class"
                character="Jim">smiled patronizingly at him</axes>, and asked:</p>
        <p><quotes>Well, Jim, are you scared?</quotes></p>
        <p><quotes>No,</quotes>said the messenger shortly.</p>
        <p><quotes>I thought we'd journeyed through the comet's tail once,</quotes>broke in the
            junior clerk affably.</p>
        <p><quotes>Oh, that was Halley's,</quotes>said the president; <quotes>this is a new comet,
                quite a stranger, they say—wonderful, wonderful! I saw it last night. Oh, by the
                way, Jim,</quotes> turning again to the messenger, <quotes>I want you to go down
                into the lower vaults today.</quotes></p>
        <p>The messenger followed the president silently. Of course, they wanted <emph
                font-style="italics">him</emph> to go down to the lower vaults. <axes
                trait="class race" character="Jim">It was too dangerous for more valuable
            men</axes>. He smiled grimly and listened.</p>
        <p><quotes>Everything of value has been moved out since the water began to seep in," said
                the president; "but we miss two volumes of old records. Suppose you nose around down
                there,—it isn't very pleasant, I suppose.</quotes></p>
        <p><quotes>Not very,</quotes> said the messenger, as he walked out.</p>
        <p><quotes>Well, Jim, <scifi trope="apocalypse">the tail of the new comet hits us at noon
                    this time</scifi>,</quotes> said the vault clerk, as he passed over the keys;
            but the messenger passed silently down the stairs. Down he went beneath Broadway, where
            the dim light filtered through the feet of hurrying men; down to the dark basement
            beneath; down into the blackness and silence beneath that lowest cavern. Here with his
            dark lantern he groped in the bowels of the earth, under the world.</p>
        <p>He drew a long breath as he threw back the last great iron door and stepped into the
            fetid slime within. <axes trait="all" character="Jim">Here at last was peace</axes>, and
            he groped moodily forward. A great rat leaped past him and cobwebs crept across his
            face. He felt carefully around the room, shelf by shelf, on the muddied floor, and in
            crevice and corner. Nothing. Then he went back to the far end, where somehow the wall
            felt different. He sounded and pushed and pried. Nothing. He started away. Then
            something brought him back. He was sounding and working again when suddenly the whole
            black wall swung as on mighty hinges, and blackness yawned beyond. He peered in; it was
            evidently a secret vault—some hiding place of the old bank unknown in newer times. He
            entered hesitatingly. It was a long, narrow room with shelves, and at the far end, an
            old iron chest. On a high shelf lay the two missing volumes of records, and others. He
            put them carefully aside and stepped to the chest. It was old, strong, and rusty. He
            looked at the vast and old-fashioned lock and flashed his light on the hinges. They were
            deeply incrusted with rust. <axes trait="class race" character="Jim">Looking about, he
                found a bit of iron and began to pry. The rust had eaten a hundred years, and it had
                gone deep. Slowly, wearily, the old lid lifted, and with a last, low groan lay bare
                its treasure—and he saw the dull sheen of gold!</axes></p>
        <p><quotes speaker="onomatoonompoeia">Boom!</quotes></p>
        <p>A low, grinding, reverberating crash struck upon his ear. He started up and looked about.
            All was black and still. He groped for his light and swung it about him. Then he knew!
            The great stone door had swung to. <axes trait="class" character="Jim">He forgot the
                gold and looked death squarely in the face.</axes> Then with a sigh he went
            methodically to work. The cold sweat stood on his forehead; but he searched, pounded,
            pushed, and worked until after what seemed endless hours his hand struck a cold bit of
            metal and the great door swung again harshly on its hinges, and then, striking against
            something soft and heavy, stopped. He had just room to squeeze through. There lay the
            body of the vault clerk, cold and stiff. He stared at it, and then felt sick and
            nauseated. The air seemed unaccountably foul, with a strong, peculiar odor. He stepped
            forward, clutched at the air, and fell fainting across the corpse.</p>
        <p>He awoke with a sense of horror, leaped from the body, and groped up the stairs, calling
            to the guard. The watchman sat as if asleep, with the gate swinging free. With one
            glance at him the messenger hurried up to the sub-vault. In vain he called to the
            guards. His voice echoed and re-echoed weirdly. Up into the great basement he rushed.
            Here another guard lay prostrate on his face, cold and still. A fear arose in the
            messenger's heart. He dashed up to the cellar floor, up into the bank. The stillness of
            death lay everywhere and everywhere bowed, bent, and stretched the silent forms of men.
            The messenger paused and glanced about. He was not a man easily moved; but the sight was
            appalling! <quotes>Robbery and murder,</quotes> he whispered slowly to himself as he saw
            the twisted, oozing mouth of the president where he lay half-buried on his desk. Then a
            new thought seized him: <axes trait="class race" character="Jim">If they found him here
                alone—with all this money and all these dead men—what would his life be
                worth?</axes> He glanced about, tiptoed cautiously to a side door, and again looked
            behind. Quietly he turned the latch and stepped out into Wall Street.</p>
        <!-- above was from homework assignment -->
        <p>How silent the street was! Not a soul was stirring, and yet it was high-noon—Wall Street?
            Broadway? He glanced almost wildly up and down, then across the street, and as he
            looked, a sickening horror froze in his limbs. With a choking cry of utter fright he
            lunged, leaned giddily against the cold building, and stared helplessly at the
            sight.</p>
        <p>In the great stone doorway a hundred men and women and children lay crushed and twisted
            and jammed, forced into that great, gaping doorway like refuse in a can—as if in one
            wild, frantic rush to safety, they had rushed and ground themselves to death. Slowly the
            messenger crept along the walls, wetting his parched mouth and trying to comprehend,
            stilling the tremor in his limbs and the rising terror in his heart. He met a business
            man, silk—hatted and frock—coated, who had crept, too, along that smooth wall and stood
            now stone dead with wonder written on his lips. The messenger turned his eyes hastily
            away and sought the curb. A woman leaned wearily against the signpost, her head bowed
            motionless on her lace and silken bosom. Before her stood a street car, silent, and
            within—but the messenger but glanced and hurried on. A grimy newsboy sat in the gutter
            with the <quotes>last edition</quotes> in his uplifted hand: <quotes speaker="text"
                >Danger!</quotes> screamed its black headlines. <quotes speaker="text">Warnings
                wired around the world. <scifi trope="apocalypse">The Comet's tail sweeps past us at
                    noon. Deadly gases expected. Close doors and windows. Seek the
                cellar.</scifi></quotes> The messenger read and staggered on. Far out from a window
            above, a girl lay with gasping face and sleevelets on her arms. On a store step sat a
            little, sweet—faced girl looking upward toward the skies, and in the carriage by her
            lay—but the messenger looked no longer. The cords gave way—the terror burst in his
            veins, and with one great, gasping cry he sprang desperately forward and ran,—ran as
            only the frightened run, shrieking and fighting the air until with one last wail of pain
            he sank on the grass of Madison Square and lay prone and still.</p>
        <p>When he rose, he gave no glance at the still and silent forms on the benches, but, going
            to a fountain, bathed his face; then hiding himself in a corner away from the drama of
            death, he quietly gripped himself and thought the thing through: <scifi
                trope="apocalypse">The comet had swept the earth and this was the end. Was everybody
                dead? He must search and see.</scifi></p>
        <p>He knew that he must steady himself and keep calm, or he would go insane. First he must
            go to a restaurant. He walked up Fifth Avenue to a famous hostelry and entered its
            gorgeous, ghost—haunted halls. He beat back the nausea, and, seizing a tray from dead
            hands, hurried into the street and ate ravenously, hiding to keep out the sights.</p>
        <p><axes trait="race class" character="Jim"><quotes>Yesterday, they would not have served
                    me,</quotes> he whispered</axes>, as he forced the food down.</p>
        <p>Then he started up the street,—looking, peering, telephoning, ringing alarms; silent,
            silent all. Was nobody—nobody—he dared not think the thought and hurried on.</p>
        <p>Suddenly he stopped still. He had forgotten. My God! How could he have forgotten? He must
            rush to the subway—then he almost laughed. No—a car; if he could find a Ford. He saw
            one. Gently he lifted off its burden, and took his place on the seat. He tested the
            throttle. There was gas. He glided off, shivering, and drove up the street. Everywhere
            stood, leaned, lounged, and lay the dead, in grim and awful silence. On he ran past an
            automobile, wrecked and overturned; past another, filled with a gay party whose smiles
            yet lingered on their death—struck lips; on past crowds and groups of cars, pausing by
            dead policemen; at 42nd Street he had to detour to Park Avenue to avoid the dead
            congestion. He came back on Fifth Avenue at 57th and flew past the Plaza and by the park
            with its hushed babies and silent throng, until as he was rushing past 72nd Street he
            heard a sharp cry, and saw a living form leaning wildly out an upper window. He gasped.
            The human voice sounded in his ears like the voice of God.</p>
        <p><quotes>Hello—hello—help, in God's name!</quotes> wailed the woman. <quotes>There's a
                dead girl in here and a man and—and see yonder dead men lying in the street and dead
                horses—for the love of God go and bring the officers——</quotes> And <axes
                trait="gender" character="Julia">the words trailed off into hysterical
            tears.</axes></p>
        <!-- Return to the below paragraph; decide how granular to go -->
        <p>He wheeled the car in a sudden circle, running over the still body of a child and leaping
            on the curb. Then he rushed up the steps and tried the door and rang violently. There
            was a long pause, but at last the heavy door swung back. They stared a moment in
            silence. <axes trait="race" character="Julia Jim">She had not noticed before that he was
                a Negro. He had not thought of her as white.</axes>
            <axes trait="class" character="Julia">She was a woman of perhaps twenty—five—rarely
                beautiful and richly gowned, with darkly—golden hair, and jewels.</axes>
            <axes trait="class race" character="Jim Julia">Yesterday, he thought with bitterness,
                she would scarcely have looked at him twice. He would have been dirt beneath her
                silken feet.</axes> She stared at him. Of all the sorts of men she had pictured as
            coming to her rescue she had not dreamed of one like him. Not that he was not human, but
            he dwelt in a world so far from hers, so infinitely far, that he seldom even entered her
            thought. Yet as she looked at him curiously he seemed quite commonplace and usual. He
            was a tall, dark workingman of the better class, with a sensitive face trained to
            stolidity and a poor man's clothes and hands. His face was soft and slow and his manner
            at once cold and nervous, like fires long banked, but not out.</p>
        <!-- Return to the above paragraph; decide how granular to go -->
        <p><scifi trope="apocalypse unity">So a moment each paused and gauged the other; then the
                thought of the dead world without rushed in and they started toward each
                other.</scifi></p>
        <p><quotes speaker="Julia">What has happened?</quotes>
            <axes trait="gender" character="Julia">she cried</axes>. <quotes speaker="Julia">Tell
                me! Nothing stirs. All is silence! I see the dead strewn before my window as
                winnowed by the breath of God,—and see——</quotes>
            <axes trait="class" character="Julia">She dragged him through great, silken hangings to
                where, beneath the sheen of mahogany and silver, a little French maid lay stretched

            livery.</axes></p>
        <p><axes trait="gender" character="Julia">The tears streamed down the woman's cheeks and she

        <p><axes trait="class" character="Julia">"I had been shut up in my dark room developing

        <!-- she answered but he said; gender because he didn't bother to ask; she is "answering" a statement -->
        <p>In ten minutes they were flying to Harlem on the wind. The Stutz rose and raced like an
            airplane. They took the turn at 110th Street on two wheels and slipped with a shriek
            into 135th.</p>
        <p>He was gone but a moment. Then he returned, and his face was gray. She did not look, but
            said:</p>
        <p><quotes speaker="Julia">You have lost—somebody?</quotes></p>
        <p><quotes speaker="Jim">I have lost—everybody,</quotes> he said, simply—<quotes

        <p><quotes speaker="Jim">Everybody,</quotes> he said, and he walked slowly back with
            something film—like in his hand which he stuffed into his pocket.</p>
        <p><quotes speaker="Jim">I'm afraid I was selfish,</quotes> he said. <axes trait="race"
                character="populace">But already the car was moving toward the park among the dark
                and lined dead of Harlem—the brown, still faces, the knotted hands, the homely
                garments, and the silence—the wild and haunting silence.</axes> Out of the park, and
            down Fifth Avenue they whirled. In and out among the dead they slipped and quivered,
            needing no sound of bell or horn, until the great, square Metropolitan Tower hove in
            sight. Gently he laid the dead elevator boy aside; the car shot upward. The door of the
            office stood open. On the threshold lay the stenographer, and, staring at her, sat the
            dead clerk. The inner office was empty, but a note lay on the desk, folded and addressed
            but unsent:</p>
        <p>Dear Daughter:</p>
        <p><axes trait="class" character="Fred">I've gone for a hundred mile spin in Fred's new

                speaker="Julia">We must search the city.</quotes></p>
        <p>Up and down, over and across, back again—on went that ghostly search. Everywhere was
            silence and death—death and silence! They hunted from Madison Square to Spuyten Duyvel;
            they rushed across the Williamsburg Bridge; they swept over Brooklyn; from the Battery
            and Morningside Heights they scanned the river. Silence, silence everywhere, and no
            human sign. Haggard and bedraggled they puffed a third time slowly down Broadway, under
            the broiling sun, and at last stopped. He sniffed the air. An odor—a smell—and with the
            shifting breeze a sickening stench filled their nostrils and brought its awful warning.

            <!-- this would actually be evidence for Julia rather than Jim but the quotes concerns him. Thinking I might remove him but idk yet -->
            In fifteen minutes they were at the central telephone exchange. <axes trait="gender"

                She heard him moving to and fro, and knew his burdens—the poor, little burdens he

                When she entered, he was alone in the room.</axes> The grim switchboard flashed its
            metallic face in cryptic, sphinx—like immobility. She seated herself on a stool and
            donned the bright earpiece. She looked at the mouthpiece. She had never looked at one so
            closely before. It was wide and black, pimpled with usage; inert; dead; almost sarcastic
            in its unfeeling curves. It looked—she beat back the thought—but it looked,—it persisted
            in looking like—she turned her head and found herself alone. One moment she was
            terrified; then she thanked him silently for his delicacy and turned resolutely, with a
            quick intaking of breath.</p>

        <p>What was that whirring? Surely—no—was it the click of a receiver?</p>
        <p>She bent close, she moved the pegs in the holes, and called and called, until her voice
            rose almost to a shriek, and her heart hammered. It was as if she had heard the last

            Her voice dropped to a sob. <axes trait="gender" character="Julia">She sat stupidly
                staring into the black and sarcastic mouthpiece</axes>, and the thought came again.
            Hope lay dead within her. Yes, the cable and the rockets remained; but the world—she
            could not frame the thought or say the word. It was too mighty—too terrible! <axes

                <!-- should it be Jim or Julia? it reflects Julia's beliefs but is about Jim --> It

            at it, with bleeding fingers, until it swung wide. She looked out. He was standing at
            the top of the alley,—silhouetted, tall and black, motionless. Was he looking at her or
            away? <!-- How to tag this previous sentence or to tag it at all --> She did not

                could not see,—of voices hushed in fearsome conspiracy. She looked behind and
                sideways, started at strange sounds and heard still stranger, until every nerve
                within her stood sharp and quivering, stretched to scream at the barest touch. She
                whirled and flew back, whimpering like a child, until she found that narrow alley
                again and the dark, silent figure silhouetted at the top. She stopped and rested;

        <p>They climbed into the car. <axes trait="class race" character="populace">She bent forward

                world of poverty and work. In the world behind them were death and silence, grave
                and grim, almost cynical, but always decent; here it was hideous. It clothed itself
                in every ghastly form of terror, struggle, hate, and suffering. It lay wreathed in
                crime and squalor, greed and lust. Only in its dread and awful silence was it like

        <p>Yet as the two, flying and alone, looked upon the horror of the world, slowly, gradually,

            did not come. Then with a start she saw him, too, standing beside the black waters.
            Slowly he removed his coat and stood there silently. She walked quickly to him and laid
            her hand on his arm. He did not start or look. The waters lapped on in luring, deadly
            rhythm. He pointed down to the waters, and said quietly:</p>

        <p>Upward they turned toward life again, and <axes trait="gender" character="Jim">he seized

        <p>He did not glimpse the glory in her eyes, but stood looking outward toward the sea and
            sending rocket after rocket into the unanswering darkness. Dark—purple clouds lay banked
            and billowed in the west. Behind them and all around, the heavens glowed in dim, weird
            radiance that suffused the darkening world and made almost a minor music. Suddenly, as
            though gathered back in some vast hand, the great cloud—curtain fell away. Low on the
            horizon lay a long, white star—mystic, wonderful! And from it fled upward to the pole,
            like some wan bridal veil, a pale, wide sheet of flame that lighted all the world and
            dimmed the stars.</p>
        <!-- I'm not sure what the above para means -->

                in his eyes and ghostly scepters hovering to his grasp. It was as though some mighty

            the entrance to the platform was filled with men, and one with white and flying hair
