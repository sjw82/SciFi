           <p>He stood a moment on the steps of the bank, watching the human river that swirled down
            Broadway. Few noticed him. Few ever noticed him save in a way that stung. He was outside
            the world—"nothing!" as he said bitterly. Bits of the words of the walkers came to
            him.</p>
        <p>"The comet?"</p>
        <p>"The comet——"</p>
        <p>Everybody was talking of it. Even the president, as he entered, smiled patronizingly at
            him, and asked:</p>
        <p>"Well, Jim, are you scared?"</p>
        <p>"No," said the messenger shortly.</p>
        <p>"I thought we'd journeyed through the comet's tail once," broke in the junior clerk
            affably.</p>
        <p>"Oh, that was Halley's," said the president; "this is a new comet, quite a stranger, they
            say—wonderful, wonderful! I saw it last night. Oh, by the way, Jim," turning again to
            the messenger, "I want you to go down into the lower vaults today."</p>
        <p> The messenger followed the president silently. Of course, they wanted him to go down to
            the lower vaults. It was too dangerous for more valuable men. He smiled grimly and
            listened.</p>
        <p> "Everything of value has been moved out since the water began to seep in," said the
            president; "but we miss two volumes of old records. Suppose you nose around down
            there,—it isn't very pleasant, I suppose."</p>
        <p>"Not very," said the messenger, as he walked out.</p>
        <p> "Well, Jim, the tail of the new comet hits us at noon this time," said the vault clerk,
            as he passed over the keys; but the messenger passed silently down the stairs. Down he
            went beneath Broadway, where the dim light filtered through the feet of hurrying men;
            down to the darkbasement beneath; down into the blackness and silence beneath that
            lowest cavern. Here with his dark lantern he groped in the bowels of the earth, under
            the world. He drew a long breath as he threw back the last great iron door and stepped
            into the fetid slime within. Here at last was peace, and he groped moodily forward. A
            great rat leaped past him and cobwebs crept across his face. He felt carefully around
            the room, shelf by shelf, on the muddied floor, and in crevice and corner. Nothing. Then
            he went back to the far end, where somehow the wall felt different. He sounded and
            pushed and pried. Nothing. He started away. Then something brought him back. He was
            sounding and working again when suddenly the whole black wall swung as on mighty hinges,
            and blackness yawned beyond. He peered in; it was evidently a secret vault—some hiding
            place of the old bank unknown in newer times. He entered hesitatingly. It was a long,
            narrow room with shelves, and at the far end, an old iron chest. On a high shelf lay the
            two missing volumes of records, and others. He put them carefully aside and stepped to
            the chest. It was old, strong, and rusty. He looked at the vast and old-fashioned lock
            and flashed his light on the hinges. They were deeply incrusted with rust. Looking
            about, he found a bit of iron and began to pry. The rust had eaten a hundred years, and
            it had gone deep. Slowly, wearily, the old lid lifted, and with a last, low groan lay
            bare its treasure—and he saw the dull sheen of gold!</p>
        <p>"Boom!"</p>
        <p> A low, grinding, reverberating crash struck upon his ear. He started up and looked
            about. All was black and still. He groped for his light and swung it about him. Then he
            knew! The great stone door had swung to. He forgot the gold and looked death squarely in
            the face. Then with a sigh he went methodically to work. The cold sweat stood on his
            forehead; but he searched, pounded, pushed, and worked until after what seemed endless
            hours his hand struck a cold bit of metal and the great door swung again harshly on its
            hinges, and then, striking against something soft and heavy, stopped. He had just room
            to squeeze through. There lay the body of the vault clerk, cold and stiff. He stared at
            it, and then felt sick and nauseated. The air seemed unaccountably foul, with a strong,
            peculiar odor. He stepped forward, clutched at the air, and fell fainting across the
            corpse.</p>
        <p>He awoke with a sense of horror, leaped from the body, and groped up the stairs, calling
            to the guard. The watchman sat as if asleep, with the gate swinging free. With one
            glance at him the messenger hurried up to the sub-vault. In vain he called to the
            guards. His voice echoed and re-echoed weirdly. Up into the great basement he rushed.
            Here another guard lay prostrate on his face, cold and still. A fear arose in the
            messenger's heart. He dashed up to the cellar floor, up into the bank. The stillness of
            death lay everywhere and everywhere bowed, bent, and stretched the silent forms of men.
            The messenger paused and glanced about. He was not a man easily moved; but the sight was
            appalling! "Robbery and murder," he whispered slowly to himself as he saw the twisted,
            oozing mouth of the president where he lay half-buried on his desk. Then a new thought
            seized him: If they found him here alone—with all this money and all these dead men—what
            would his life be worth? He glanced about, tiptoed cautiously to a side door, and again
            looked behind. Quietly he turned the latch and stepped out into Wall Street.</p></section>
