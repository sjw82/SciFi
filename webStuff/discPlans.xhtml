            <h3><a id="about">Creating a Discussion Plan</a></h3>
            <p>When following this methodology, the process of creating a discussion plan doesn't
                change. What changes it what kinds of questions get asked.</p>
            <p>When creating a discussion plan it is important to choose which aspects of the story
                to highlight and focus on. In our examples, we have chosen to highlight race, class,
                gender, orientation, and ability all as possible vectors by which to conduct
                discussion.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, only you know your students and what they're capable of.
                Challenge them, but use your discression when choosing and writing questions.</p>
            <h3><a id="template">Template</a></h3>
            <p>Focus on questions that challenge students to acknowledge their point of view and to
                recognize others.</p>
