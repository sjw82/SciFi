        <p>Everybody was talking of it. Even the president, as he entered, <axes trait="class race"

        <p>The <litdev dev="allusion">messenger</litdev> followed the president silently. Of course,

            room, shelf by shelf, on the muddied floor, and in crevice and corner. Nothing. Then he
            went back to the far end, where somehow the wall felt different. He sounded and pushed
            and pried. Nothing. He started away. Then something brought him back. He was sounding
            and working again when suddenly the whole black wall swung as on mighty hinges, and
                <litdev dev="meta">blackness yawned beyond</litdev>. He peered in; <q

                qual="critThink">it was evidently a secret vault—some hiding place of the old bank

            shelves, and at the far end, an old iron chest.
            <!--What is the metaphor behind missing but forgotten records? Hint I'm guessing slavery and records of people"-->
            On a high shelf lay the two missing volumes of records, and others. He put them
            carefully aside and stepped to the chest. <q

            old-fashioned lock and flashed his light on the hinges. They were deeply incrusted with
            rust. <axes trait="class race" character="Jim">Looking about, he found a bit of iron and
                began to pry. The rust had eaten a hundred years, and it had gone deep. Slowly,
                wearily, the old lid lifted, and with a last, low groan lay bare its treasure—and he
                saw the dull sheen of
            gold!</axes><!-- I don't recall why I put this on these axes. Yes I do, the passage of time since slavery, ebbing at the hierarchy of white supremacy --></p>
        <p><litdev dev="on"><quotes speaker="onomatoonompoeia">Boom!</quotes></litdev></p>
        <p><litdev dev="image" imagery="audio">A low, grinding, reverberating crash</litdev> struck
            upon his ear. He started up and looked about. All was black and still. He groped for his
            light and swung it about him. Then he knew! <q
                quest="What would have happened if the stone door hadn't sealed Jim into the anex?"
                qual="critThink">The great stone door had swung to.</q>
            <axes trait="class" character="Jim">He forgot the gold and looked death squarely in the
                face.</axes>
            <axes trait="class" character="Jim">Then with a sigh he went methodically to
                work.</axes> The cold sweat stood on his forehead; but he searched, pounded, pushed,
            and worked until after what seemed endless hours his hand struck a cold bit of metal and
            the great door swung again harshly on its hinges, and then, striking against something
            soft and heavy, stopped. He had just room to squeeze through. There lay the body of the
            vault clerk, cold and stiff.
            <!-- what is the vault clerk doing down here? Did he run down the stairs and through the chambers to the bowels of the Earth as he was poisoned? -->
            He stared at it, and then felt sick and nauseated. The air seemed unaccountably foul,
            with a strong, peculiar odor. <litdev dev="image" imagery="horror">He stepped forward,
                clutched at the air, and fell fainting across the corpse.</litdev></p>
        <p>He awoke with a sense of horror, leaped from the body, and groped up the stairs, calling
            to the guard. The watchman sat as if asleep, with the gate swinging free. With one
            glance at him the <litdev dev="allusion">messenger</litdev> hurried up to the sub-vault.
            In vain he called to the guards. His voice echoed and re-echoed weirdly. Up into the
            great basement he rushed. Here another guard lay prostrate on his face, cold and still.
            A fear arose in the <litdev dev="allusion">messenger</litdev>'s heart. He dashed up to
            the cellar floor, up into the bank. <litdev dev="image" imagery="horror">The stillness
                of death lay everywhere and everywhere bowed, bent, and stretched the silent forms
                of men.</litdev> The <litdev dev="allusion">messenger</litdev> paused and glanced
            about. He was not a man easily moved; but the sight was appalling! <quotes>Robbery and
                murder,</quotes> he whispered slowly to himself as he saw the twisted, oozing mouth
            of the president where he lay half-buried on his desk. Then a new thought seized him: <q
                quest="Put yourself in Jim's shoes. If you were in this situation what would you think? What would you do?"
                qual="dbt"><axes trait="class race" character="Jim">If they found him here
                    alone—with all this money and all these dead men—what would his life be
                    worth?</axes></q> He glanced about, tiptoed cautiously to a side door, and again
            looked behind. Quietly he turned the latch and stepped out into <setting
                place="WallStreet">Wall Street</setting>.</p>
        <p>How silent the street was! Not a soul was stirring, and yet it was <setting time="noon"
                >high-noon</setting>—<setting place="wall street">Wall Street</setting>? <setting
                place="broadway">Broadway</setting>? He glanced almost wildly up and down, then
            across the street, and as he looked, a sickening horror froze in his limbs. With a
            choking cry of utter fright he lunged, leaned giddily against the cold building, and
            stared helplessly at the sight.</p>
        <p><litdev dev="image" imagery="horror">In the great stone doorway <litdev dev="sim">a
                    hundred men and women and children lay crushed and twisted and jammed, forced

                frantic rush to safety, they had rushed and ground themselves to death.</litdev>
            Slowly the <litdev dev="allusion">messenger</litdev> crept along the walls, wetting his
            parched mouth and trying to comprehend, stilling the tremor in his limbs and the rising
            terror in his heart. <q
                quest="With the information you have so far, make an educated guess as to what happened while Jim was in the cellar."
                qual="critThink">He met a business man, silk—hatted and frock—coated, who had crept,
                too, along that smooth wall and stood now stone dead with wonder written on his
                lips.</q> The <litdev dev="allusion">messenger</litdev> turned his eyes hastily away
            and sought the curb. A woman leaned wearily against the signpost, her head bowed
            motionless on her lace and silken bosom. Before her stood a street car, silent, and
            within—but the <litdev dev="allusion">messenger</litdev> but glanced and hurried on.

            cords <!-- what does the cords refer to? --> gave way—the terror burst in his veins, and
            with one great, gasping cry he sprang desperately forward and ran,—ran as only the
            frightened run, shrieking and fighting the air until with one last wail of pain he sank
            on the grass of <setting place="madisonSquare">Madison Square</setting> and lay prone
            and still.</p>
        <p>When he rose, he gave no glance at the still and silent forms on the benches, but, going
            to a fountain, bathed his face; then hiding himself in a corner away from <litdev
                dev="metaphore">the drama of death</litdev>, he quietly gripped himself and thought
            the thing through: <scifi trope="apocalypse">The comet had swept the earth and this was
                the end. Was everybody dead? He must search and see.</scifi></p>
        <p>He knew that he must steady himself and keep calm, or he would go insane. First he must
            go to a restaurant. He walked up <setting place="fifthAve">Fifth Avenue</setting> to
                <setting place="restaurant">a famous hostelry</setting> and entered its gorgeous,
            ghost—haunted halls. He beat back the nausea, and, seizing a tray from dead hands,
            hurried into the street and ate ravenously, hiding to keep out the sights.</p>
        <p><axes trait="race class" character="Jim"><quotes>Yesterday, they would not have served
                    me,</quotes> he whispered</axes>, as he forced the food down.</p>
        <p>Then he started up the street,—looking, peering, telephoning, ringing alarms; silent,
            silent all. Was nobody—nobody—he dared not think the thought and hurried on.</p>
        <p>Suddenly he stopped still. He had forgotten. My God! How could he have forgotten? <litdev
                dev="motif" motif="technology">He must rush to the subway—then he almost laughed.
                No—a car; if he could find a Ford.</litdev> He saw one. Gently he lifted off its
            burden, and took his place on the seat. He tested the throttle. There was gas. He glided
            off, shivering, and drove up the street. Everywhere stood, <litdev dev="alliteration"
                >leaned, lounged, and lay</litdev> the dead, in grim and awful silence. On he ran
            past an automobile, wrecked and overturned; past another, filled with a gay party whose
            smiles yet lingered on their death—struck lips; on past crowds and groups of cars,
            pausing by dead policemen; at <setting place="42ndStreet ParkAvenue">42nd
